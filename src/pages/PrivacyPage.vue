      <h1 class="text-h4">Privacy and Security</h1>
      <p>
        We take your privacy and security seriously. Here's how we protect your
        information and ensure a safe experience on Gloomy Chat:
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-h5">Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        All communication on Gloomy Chat is encrypted using industry-standard
        encryption protocols. This ensures that your messages, photos, and other
        data are secure and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h5">Account Security</h2>
      <p>
        To enhance your account security, we recommend using a strong and unique
        password. Additionally, you can enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
        for an extra layer of protection. With 2FA, you'll need to provide a
        verification code along with your password when logging in.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h5">Data Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share your personal information with third parties without
        your explicit consent. Your data is used only to provide the services
        offered by Gloomy Chat and to enhance your user experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h5">Reporting and Blocking</h2>
      <p>
        If you encounter any suspicious or inappropriate behavior on Gloomy
        Chat, you can report users or content to our moderation team. You can
        also block users to prevent further communication with them.
      </p>
